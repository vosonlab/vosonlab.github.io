The VOSON Lab has recently published to github a new open source R package called [voson.tcn](https://vosonlab.github.io/voson.tcn) that uses the Early-Access Twitter API v2 to collect tweets identified as part of specified threaded conversations and generate networks. This is now possible in the v2 API thanks to a new tweet identifier called the `conversation_id` that is common to all tweets that are part of a conversation and can be searched for using the API search end-points. Identifiers and associated metadata for referenced tweets can also be collected during a search for conversation tweets, allowing us to construct twitter networks with rich tweet and user metadata.
