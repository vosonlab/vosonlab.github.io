This post introduces VOSONDash network analysis tools, which include network visualisation, network metrics, and text analysis. Users can analyse different networks including those collected with VOSONDash (Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and Hyperlinks), or import `graphml` files collected elsewhere. 

*Analysing online networks with VOSONDash* is the first of a series of posts where we will cover VOSONDash features. 

### About VOSONDash

VOSONDash is an output of computational social methods research, designed to be a "Swiss Army knife" for studying online networks. The [R/Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboard tool enables online data collection, and network and text analysis (including visualisation) within the same environment. VOSONDash builds on a number of R packages, in particular [vosonSML](http://vosonlab.net/SocialMediaLab) for data collection and network generation, and [igraph](https://igraph.org/) for network analysis. The package provides a graphical user interface which does not require users to have R programming skills and it is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VOSONDash) and [GitHub](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash). Bryan Gertzel is the lead developer and maintainer of VOSONDash.

### Starting VOSONDash

The [GitHub page](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash) provides instructions to install VOSONDash via R or Rstudio. Once the package is installed, run VOSONDash from the RStudio console entering the following code. VOSONDash will open in a web browser

```{r pages, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(VOSONDash)
runVOSONDash()
```




### Network data

To ease replication, in this example we will use the `EnviroActivistsWebsite_2006` demo dataset which is provided in the package. The dataset is a hyperlink network collected with [VOSON](http://vosonlab.net/VOSON) in 2006, as part of a research piece [@acklandoneil2011]. The network has 161 nodes (websites representing environmental organisations) and 1,444 edges representing hyperlinks between these organisations. In this dataset, text data is stored as node attribute and categorical values are assigned depending on type of environmental organisations (Bios, Globals, and Toxics). 

## Network analysis using VOSONDash

There are three main approaches to analysing online networks with VOSONDash: Network graph, Network metrics (SNA), and Text analysis. More information on features can be accessed in the [VOSONDash Userguide](https://vosonlab.github.io/VOSONDashDocs/).

### Network graph
 
In `Network graph` provides two options to explore networks: network visualisation via igraph and [visNetwork](https://github.com/datastorm-open/visNetwork); and tabulations for nodes and edges. The `Network graph` pane provides the following options for manipulating the network:

- Labels -- to display or not labels.
- Graph Filters -- to display or not multiple edges, loops, and isolates.
- Layout -- to select graph layout and spread.
- Node Size -- to select node size by metric e.g. indegree and define size (multiplier).
- Categorical filter -- option available when data contains pre-set categorical values. New collections do not have that option.
- Component filter -- to display weak or strong components and define component range. 
- Neighbourhood select -- to create subnetworks. It uses ego network terminology of order, where order 1 include ties between the alters.

### Network metrics

Via the `Network metrics` pane, we can observe basic SNA metrics, including network level and node level metrics (e.g. centralisation). `Network metrics` reflect the applied filters for the visualisation; in this example we removed isolates (3 nodes), so network size is 158 and the Component distribution is 1 (one connected component). `Degree distribution` is only available for undirected networks; `Indegree distribution` and `Outdegree distribution` charts are available for directed networks, like this example. Accordingly, in this network, there are 15 nodes receiving one hyperlink, and three nodes receiving 35 hyperlinks. While 19 nodes link out to only one other site, there are two organisations in this network that link out to 50 sites.

`Assortativity metrics` (Homogeneity and Homophily indexes, including mixing matrix and population share) are presented for networks with categorical node attributes. In this example, we have selected the categorical attribute `Type`. The mixing matrix table presents links across the three types of organisations Globals, Bios and Toxics. The Bios and Globals sub-movements show a strong tendency towards linking to their own type. Population shares, Homogeneity indexes and Homophily indexes are presented by type. Controlling for group size, Globals are the group more biased towards its own type, where 53% of their ties to other Global organisations can be explained by homophily.

### Text analysis

For a network with text data stored as either node or edge attribute, it is possible to conduct basic text analysis with VOSONDash. Text corpus can be pre-processed using `Filters` to:

- remove common English words that are not relevant to the analysis, such as “and”, “the”, and “but” using `Remove Standard Stopwords`,
- create own stopword list in `User-Defined Stopwords`, 
- reduce words to their stems with `Apply word stemming`, 
- remove URLs, numbers, or punctuation, based on user's specifications.
- `Word lenght`, if need to specify number of characters.
- `Advanced options` provide `HTML Decode` and `iconv UTF8`, specially useful for social media as text often contains encoded characters.
- For Twitter networks, two other options become available: `Remove Twitter hashtags` and `Remove Twitter Usernames`.

There are three methods available to visualise text: 

- `Word frequency` bar charts, where further parameters can be applied such as to define the number of results displayed, and frequency to define `Minimum frequency`, for the text to appear.
 
- `Word clouds`  where users can adjust `Minimum frequency` (how many times a word needs to have been used in order for it to feature in the visualisation); `Maximum words` to control for the number of words appearing in the graph; percentage of vertical words can be set for legibility; and random colours can be assigned to the visualisation. `Comparison clouds` are only available for datasets with categorical data, like this example where colour represents the  node attribute type (Bios, Globals or Toxics).

- The `Sentiment analysis` function uses the [Syuzhet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html) package and classifies words based on the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive).

We hope this guide has been useful and easy to follow. In the next post, we will cover Reddit data collection with VOSONDash.
