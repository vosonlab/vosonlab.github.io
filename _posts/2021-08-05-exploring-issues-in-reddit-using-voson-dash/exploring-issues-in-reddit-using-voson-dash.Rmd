The following guide, provides a practical demonstration to studying online networks of Reddit data, using VOSON Lab's interactive R/Shiny app `VOSONDash`.

 
## Exloring an issue in Reddit

Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Posts,are organised by subject into user-created boards called "communities" or "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, religion, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets, and image-sharing. Reddit provides the opportunity for researchers to access themed-based online discussion data, and to understand the dynamics of these conversations. 

### SNA approach to studying online networks

`VOSONDash` and `vosonSML` method for network construction is based on [Ackland and Zhu]'s approach, whereby edges in Reddit networks are *implicitly directed ties*, representing exchange of opinion between users, but not necessarily an explicit social relationship, such as friendship. Reddit conversations threads can be analysed as networks and `VOSONDash` provides two approaches to constructing networks:

*Actor networks -- where nodes represent users have posted original posts and comments, and edges are the comment interactions between users.

*Activity networks -- where nodes are comments or initial thread posts and edges represent either replies to the original post, or replies to comments.

### methodology
In this demonstration, we will collect data from a Reddit post relating to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney, Australia, and proceed to use `VOSONDash` features to demonstrate the data outputs and analysis tools.

The post titled [*Sydneyâ€™s lockdown extended by 4 weeks*](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/osjreh/sydneys_lockdown_extended_by_4_weeks/) was created on July, 21, 2021, and by the time of data collection (August, 08, 2021) it had attracted 420 comments.


## Starting VOSON Dash

The GitHub page provides instructions to install `VOSONDash`. Once the package is installed run `VOSONDash` from the RStudio console entering the following code:

```{r pages, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(VOSONDash)
runVOSONDash()
```

VOSONDash will open in a web browser. More detail on features can be accessed in the [`VOSONDash` Userguide](https://vosonlab.github.io/VOSONDashDocs/)


## Collecting Reddit data
Simply go to the Reddit view, enter the URL, and click on `Collect Threads`. The output of the collection is presented in the right pane (Figure 1). In this example, 411 comments were collected. At this stage, the data can be saved as `.rds` dataframe.
[difference 420, no new comments added?]

## Creating Reddit activity networks with VOSONDash 

This type of network represents the three-like structure of conversations, with nodes being comments or the initial post, and edges being replies to comments or replies to initial post. In this example, we selected the `Add text` option, so the `.graphml` file contains text data.

The console displays the output of the activity network (Figure 2). The *Activity network* has 412 nodes (including the initial post), and 411 edges (comments). The network can be saved ad `.graphml`, if you prefer to use a different tool for analysis.

## Creating Reddit activity networks with VOSONDash 

Activity networks represent the actual conversation interaction between Reddit users, where nodes represent users and edges are comments. Similarly, we selected `Activity network` and , `Add text` options. Figure 3 presents a visualisation of the network we just generated, with node size by indegree and directional tie.

## Creating Reddit actor networks with VOSONDash

In a similar workflow, we can use the data we just collected to create *Actor networks*, to observe Reddit users interactions. As mentioned earlier, in *Actor networks*, nodes are comments or initial thread posts, and edges represent either replies to the original post, or replies to comments. Again, the `Add text` option was selected, for the `.graphml` file to contain text data.

The console displays the output of the activity network once the network is created. Figure 4 presents the network visualisation pane (eye icon), The *Activity network* has 247 nodes, and 405 edges. Node size by indegree.
