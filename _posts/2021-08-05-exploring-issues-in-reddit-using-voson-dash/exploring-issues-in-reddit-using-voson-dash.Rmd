The following guide provides a practical demonstration for collecting [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) data and constructing networks, using VOSON Lab's interactive [R/Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app [VOSONDash](http://vosonlab.net/voson-dashboard). Reddit -- a social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website -- provides the opportunity for researchers to access a wide range of themed-based online discussion data, and to understand the dynamics of these conversations. 

### SNA approach to studying online networks

VOSONDash (and `vosonSML`) method for network construction is based on @AcklandZhu2015 approach, whereby edges in Reddit networks represent *implicitly directed ties*, i.e.  reflecting exchange of opinion between users rather than an explicit social relationship. Conversations threads can be analysed as networks and VOSONDash provides two approaches to constructing Reddit networks:

- *Actor networks* -- where nodes represent users who have posted original posts and comments, and edges are the comment interactions between users.

- *Activity networks* -- where nodes are comments or initial thread posts and edges represent either replies to the original post, or replies to comments.

### Methodology

In this example, we will collect data from a Reddit post relating to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney, Australia, and proceed to use VOSONDash features to demonstrate the data outputs and a quick overview of analysis tools. 

The post titled [*Sydney Lockdown extended until the end of September*](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/p7s5s6/sydney_lockdown_extended_until_the_end_of/) was created on 20 August 2021, and by the time of data collection (23 September 2021) it had attracted 557 comments.

The [GitHub page](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash) provides instructions to install and run VOSONDash. More information on features can be accessed in the [VOSONDash Userguide](https://vosonlab.github.io/VOSONDashDocs/).

## Collecting Reddit data

Reddit collection does not require API authentication. Simply go to the Reddit view, enter the URL, and click on `Collect Threads`. The output of the collection is presented in the right pane (Figure 1). In this example, 494 comments were collected. At this stage, the data can be saved as `.rds` dataframe.

## Creating Reddit Activity networks with VOSONDash 

*Activity networks* represent the three-like structure of conversations, with nodes being comments or the initial post, and edges being replies to comments or replies to initial post. In this example, we selected the `Add text` option, so the `.graphml` file contains text data.

The console displays the output of the activity network (Figure 2). The *Activity network* has 495 nodes (including the initial post), and 494 edges (comments). The network can be saved ad `.graphml`, if you prefer to use a different tool for analysis. 


## Creating Reddit Actor networks with VOSONDash

In a similar workflow, we can use the data we just collected to create *Actor networks*, to observe Reddit users interactions. As mentioned earlier, in *Actor networks*, nodes are users who have commented, or who have created initial thread posts, and edges represent either replies to the original post, or replies to comments. Again, the `Add text` option was selected, for the `.graphml` file to contain text data.

The console displays the output of the activity network once the network is created. The *Activity network* has 302 nodes, and 495 edges.

VOSONDash provides three approaches to analyse networks: `Network graph`, `Network metrics` (SNA), and `Text analysis`. These tools are presented in more detail in the post [*Analysing networks with VOSONDash*](https://vosonlab.github.io/posts/2021-08-06-analysing-online-networks-with-vosondash/).

We hope this guide has been useful and easy to follow. In the next post, we will cover Twitter data collection with VOSONDash.
