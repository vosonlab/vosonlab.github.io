With over 3,000 registered users worldwide, a considerable number of academic publications using `VOSON`, and its high usage rate as an empirical tool for hyperlink and text data collection, we decided to integrate `VOSON` abilities into our open-source R package: `vosonSML`.

Hyperlink collection is now available in `voson.sml` development version 0.30.900, on [GitHub](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML).


## Introduction

The Web 1.0 -- extensive network of websites- has been widely studied and continue to be relevant for researchers. Some examples of research include studying online social movements (Ackland and O’Neil, 2011; Lusher and Ackland, 2011; McIlwain, 2017), and networks around issue spheres (Adamic and Glance, 2005; Ackland and Evans, 2015).

From a social science perspective, there is a wide range of tools available for studying hyperlink networks. Some examples are:

* [Hyphe](https://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/), a curated-oriented approach to web crawling developed at Sciences Po Paris Médialab (Jacomy et al., 2016). 

* [Issuecrawler](http://www.govcom.org/Issuecrawler_instructions.htm), developed at the University of Amsterdam to study issue networks (Rogers, 2013).

* [SocSciBot](http://socscibot.wlv.ac.uk/), developed by the Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group, University of Wolverhampton, to study citation networks (Thelwall, 2001).

* [VOSON](http://vosonlab.net/VOSON), a web-based tool developed at the VOSON Lab to empirically study social hyperlink networks, with a substantive focus on organisational WWW hyperlink networks and blog networks (Ackland et al., 2006). 

### About the VOSON Software

![vosonSML](vsml_logo.png){ style='float:right;width:180px !important;height:208px !important;' }The ´VOSON´ Software is one output of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks [VOSON] Project. The tool integrates data collection features, analysis and visualisation of hyperlink networks. 

The first version of `VOSON` (or Uberlink, as it was known then) with a graphical user interface was released internally in 2004, as a desktop application built using the `Qt` cross-platform application framework. A decision was made to port `VOSON` to a web application version built using the `PHP` web programming language and associated `AJAX` libraries. The first version of the web app was internally released in 2005. 

In 2010, under a licensing arrangement with the ANU, [Uberlink Corporation](https://www.uberlink.com/) started commercially hosting and developing `VOSON`, reaching over 3,000 registered users worldwide. 

Ten years after, we decided to make the ´VOSON´ legacy available via open-source R environment (´vosonSML´). Following similar methodological steps, `vosonSML` crawls websites (internally and/or externally) and, in line with the other data sources (Twitter, Reddit and YouTube), generates two type of networks: *actor networks* - where pagegroups (websites) are nodes, and  *activity networks* - where single web pages are nodes.
