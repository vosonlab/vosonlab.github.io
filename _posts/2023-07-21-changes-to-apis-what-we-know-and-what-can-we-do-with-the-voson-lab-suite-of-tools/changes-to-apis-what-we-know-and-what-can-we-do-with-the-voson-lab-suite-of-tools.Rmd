# Introduction

Recently, social media companies have announced major changes to API access and data, specifically for Twitter and Reddit. In this post we cover what we have found so far and the implications in the use of the VOSON lab suit of tools: vosonSML, VOSONDash and voson.tcn, as at 21 July 2023.


# Reddit

## Changes to reddit API

Reddit announced changes to its API effective on 30 June 2023. [This publication](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/apifacts) summarises the changes to API. Basically, Reddit is restricting API access to commercial entities that require large-scale data usage. Reddit data can still be accessed for free for academic purposes (non-profit), as long as it is below the published data-usage threshold. 

[As of July 1, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/#:~:text=Rate%20limits%20for%20the%20free%20tier&text=Many%20of%20you%20already%20know,minute%20per%20OAuth%20client%20id), Reddit enforced two different rate limits for the free access tier: 

* 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id (i.e. those using OAuth for authentication)

* 10 queries per minute, for those who are not using OAuth for authentication.

## Can I collect Reddit data using the VOSON Lab tools?

As at 21 July 2023, it is possible to access Reddit data using `vosonSML` ([v. 0.37.7](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML)) and `VOSONDash`([0.5.11](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash)). The Reddit API end-point used does not require authentication for `vosonSML`, which means that there should not be problems with small collections.

## future developments

We are working towards ensuring Reddit collection via `vosonSML` adheres to the new rate-limits. There is a wait time already applied in-between thread collection requests (3-5 seconds or theoretical maximum of 20 requests per minute), however the number of requests will depend on the number of threads and if they have 'continue' threads. This should not significantly affect small collections.

More specifications can be found [here](https://vosonlab.github.io/vosonSML/reference/Collect.thread.reddit.html).


# Twitter

For Twitter, changes to the API access have been significant. [This post](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet/issues/761) by `rtweet` developers summarises the changes of API access since February until June 2023. [On 9 February 2023](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922), Twitter cut off free access to both of its APIs (v2 and v1.1) and included a paid basic tier. [Legacy Twitter API access tiers, such as Standard (v1.1), Essential (v2), Elevated (v2), and Premium were deprecated by June 2023](https://twittercommunity.com/t/deprecation-of-legacy-access-tiers-in-the-twitter-api/196162). The Applications and projects which were not switched were placed in the default [new Free access tier](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-new-access-tiers-for-the-twitter-api/188728), which supports V1.1 Media Endpoints, V1.1 OAuth endpoints (Login with Twitter), V2 Manage Tweet endpoints
and V2 users/me endpoint, for *write only* use cases.


----- This is info about free tier (delete before publishing)
Free

For write-only use cases with the Twitter API

Low rate-limit access to v2 tweet posting and media upload endpoints
1,500 Tweets per month posting limit - at the app level
1 app ID
Login with Twitter
Cost: Free

Rob and Bryan: based on the information above, Bryan's Elevated access was deprecated to Free. Basically, you would have to request for your app to be unsuspended.

## Can I collect Twitter data using the VOSON Lab tools?

Based on the information above, if you have a developer account, with access to the v.1.1 API endpoint, you should be able to collect Twitter data with `voson.SML` using a paid tier. We have not tested this option, yet. 

Also, please note that `vosonSML` only accesses the Twitter v1.1 API via `rtweet` and does not support the newer v2 API. You can refer to the [`voson.tcn` package](https://github.com/vosonlab/voson.tcn) if you are interested in using the v2 API to collect and analyse Twitter conversation networks.

To date, it is unclear what is going to happen to Twitter access for academics.  (Rob, could you please test if works?)
