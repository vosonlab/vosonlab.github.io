Welcome to the [VOSON Lab](http://vosonlab.net/) Coding Blog! We have created this space to share methods, tips, examples and code. A place to collect data, construct and analyse online networks. 

Most of our posts will cover techniques around the tools we have developed at the Lab: `vosonSML` and `VOSONDash`, which are available on CRAN and Github. In this space, we also plan to cover other complementary R packages and open-source software such as: the Tidyverse, `igraph`, `Shiny` and `gephi`.

### VOSON Lab Open Source Tools

![VOSON Tools](VOSON-tools.png)
`vosonSML` is a R package for social media data collection (Twitter, YouTube and Reddit) and network generation. `VOSONDash` is a `Shiny` app which integrates tools for visualizing and manipulating network graphs, performing network and text analysis, and a collection interface for `vosonSML`.

More information on these tools can be found on their GitHub pages: [`vosonSML`](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML) and
[`VOSONDash`](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash). 

For more detailed information, check the [vosonSML Vignette](https://vosonlab.github.io/vosonSML/articles/Intro-to-vosonSML.html) and the [VOSON Dash Userguide](https://vosonlab.github.io/VOSONDashDocs/). 

We hope you find this information useful!
